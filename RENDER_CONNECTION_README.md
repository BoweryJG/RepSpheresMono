# Render Connection Fix

This directory contains scripts and documentation for fixing and testing the connection to the Render backend service.

## Background

The Market Insights application uses a backend service hosted on Render. Due to Render's free tier limitations, the service can sometimes go to sleep after periods of inactivity, causing connection issues. Additionally, network errors and other transient issues can cause API calls to fail.

The connection fix implements several improvements to make the application more resilient to these issues:

1. A wake-up mechanism that proactively pings the service before making API calls
2. Retry logic that automatically retries failed API calls
3. Enhanced error handling that provides graceful degradation
4. Direct API methods that bypass the apiService for more reliable connections

## Scripts

### check-render-status.js

A simple utility script to check if the Render service is up and responding.

```bash
node check-render-status.js
```

This script:
- Sends a request to the Render service's health endpoint
- Measures the response time
- Displays the status and any response data
- Provides helpful error messages if the connection fails

### direct-test-render-fix.js

A comprehensive test script that verifies all aspects of the Render connection fix.

```bash
node direct-test-render-fix.js
```

This script tests:
- The wake-up mechanism
- The module access endpoint
- Storing data to the market insights endpoint
- Retrieving data from the market insights endpoint
- The retry logic and error handling

### test-render-fix.js

A test script that attempts to use the marketInsightsApiService.js module directly. Note that this script may encounter import issues due to the way Node.js handles ESM imports.

## Documentation

### RENDER_CONNECTION_RESULTS.md

Contains the results of testing the Render connection fix, including:
- A summary of the test results
- Details of the connection fix implementation
- Conclusions and next steps

### RENDER_BACKEND_INTEGRATION.md

Contains information about the Render backend integration, including:
- The backend API endpoints
- How to set up and configure the backend
- Deployment instructions

## Implementation Details

The connection fix is implemented in the following files:

- `src/services/marketInsightsApiService.js`: The enhanced API service with retry logic and wake-up mechanism
- `src/services/apiService.js`: The core API service for making HTTP requests
- `src/services/config.js`: Configuration for the API service

## Usage in the Application

To use the enhanced marketInsightsApiService in the application:

```javascript
import marketInsightsApiService from './services/marketInsightsApiService';

// Example: Store market insights data
const userId = 'user123';
const data = { /* your data here */ };
marketInsightsApiService.storeMarketInsights(userId, data)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Data stored successfully:', response);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error storing data:', error);
  });

// Example: Retrieve market insights data
marketInsightsApiService.getMarketInsights(userId)
  .then(response => {
    console.log('Data retrieved successfully:', response.data);
  })
  .catch(error => {
    console.error('Error retrieving data:', error);
  });
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter connection issues with the Render backend:

1. Run the `check-render-status.js` script to verify that the service is up
2. Check the browser console for error messages
3. Verify that the API_BASE_URL in `src/services/apiService.js` is correct
4. Try using the direct methods in marketInsightsApiService (directStoreMarketInsights, directGetMarketInsights)
5. If the service is consistently down, check the Render dashboard for any issues
